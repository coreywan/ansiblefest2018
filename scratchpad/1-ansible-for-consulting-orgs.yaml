ansible_for_consulting_orgs:
  speaker: aaron eisler - head of automation Telstra
  digital_strategy:
    - underpin any automation strategy with a good digital strategy
    - variability and variation is high in consulting role
    - Suggested read: Digital Transformation playbook book
    - key pieces: [fast innovation, differentiated service, enhanced value, data digitised]
  build:
    - new battleground is right above the network controller. 
    - Build cross platform orchestration as a integrator
  knowledge_management:
    - make once use many
    - source of truth for best practice
    - reduced repetition
    - Get together to agree on the fundamentals to remove silos of automation mechanisms
    - proof of concepts and validation
    - cusotmer agreed standards
    - telstra agreed standards
    - knowledge transfer is system ic
    - important to build the standards correctly so that playbooks/roles/code can be re-used between customers
    - the standards gives people the confidence on know how your code will work with another team's code.
    - the ability to separate the intellectual property
  leverage_automation_across_accounts:
    - our ip in playbooks
    - customer ip in configurations on the customer site
    - telstra has 400 PS Network Engineers
  why_ansible:
    - reusablity of ip
    - quite difficult to teach software engineers how to be a network engineer
    - open source culture
    - enable the front line
    - Use AWX as a method to do a POC in the customer environment before operationalizing
  commercializing_automation:
    - this enabled them to talk higher in the stack: [marketing teams, business teams, application teams]
    - spend less timeon the consult design build with the automated route since it is all baked in.
  getting_funding:
    - baseline activity
    - calculate how long it will take with automation
    - find difference to cash flow via increased savigns or additional revenue
    - imporvement  = increased cash flow
  capability_plan:
    - plans to develop the staff.
    - test labs for network engineers to use.
    - levels: [beginner, senior, principal, distinguished]
    - weekly use case demos
  questions:
    how do you protect your own IP: the value they get from having additional conversations with other business units (outside network engineers) are much higher than loosing that IP.
