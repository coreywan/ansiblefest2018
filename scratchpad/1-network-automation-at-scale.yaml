net_auto_at_scale:
  speaker: Landon Holley and James Mighion
  what_is_it:
    - infrastructure as yaml
    - config mgmt
    - ensure an ongoing steady state
  ansible_for_network_eng:
    - used roles
    - they deployed roles based on setting a single task. (IE Set snmp)  Then in the role tasks it contained the logic to take into account the differences between vendors
  at_scale:
    key_factors:
      - config size -- raw text of show run
      - device performance -- time to login / send commands / get output
      - inventory sizes and device families (ios/nxos/etc)
      - frequency and extent of scheduling device changes
      - use or availability of network facts
    sizing:
      - linear gain when adding CPUs
      - bigger isn't always better:
          - more small tower instances
          - create small inv and use job limits
          - use lots of small jobs
      - use facts and fact caching
    challenges:
      - git and linux training
      - variability of device versions
      - limited hardware
      - scaling ansible/tower
      - snowflake devices
      - defining source of truth
    lessons_learned:
      - effectively scaling ansible/tower (there are improvements in Tower 3.3 that help with the effeciencies) (auto sharding in 3.4 tower [matt jones is working on the sharding])
      - writing effective roles
      - creative logic for brown field and generic device management
